# Communication Protocols in Verilog (UART, SPI, I2C)

 I  have successfully completed communication series part 1 course on udemy, in which gained hands-on experience in implementing industry-standard serial communication protocols—UART, SPI, and I2C—using Verilog HDL. I learned how to design, simulate, and verify these interfaces, covering concepts such as UART 16550A implementation, SPI modes and daisy-chain operation, and I2C bit-banging techniques. The course strengthened my understanding of timing, synchronization, and protocol-level signaling, while also enhancing my ability to write efficient, synthesizable Verilog code. By applying these protocols to practical design examples, I developed strong skills in integrating communication modules within FPGA/ASIC projects, preparing me to handle real-world digital system design challenges.
